It is assumed that you have Drupal up and running.  Be sure to check
the Drupal web site if you need assistance.  If you run into problems,
you should always read the INSTALL.txt that comes with the Drupal
package and read the online documentation.

1. Place the signup package into your Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Enable the signup module by navigating to: Administer > Site building > modules

   Note: if you want support for automatic closing of events and
   reminder emails you must also install and enable the event package!

   Click the 'Save configuration' button at the bottom to commit your
   changes.

3. For the final configuration of the module, navigate to
   Administer > Site configuration > Signup

   Here you can configure the options for the module.

4. Enable the node types that you wish to allow signups for under

   Administer > Content management > Content types

   You may wish to create a new content type specifically for event
   signups using either the Flexinode module or the Content
   Construction Kit (CCK).

5. Grant the proper access to user accounts under: Administer > User management > Access control
   
   allow signups: allows the selected role to sign up for nodes

   NOTE: Enabling 'allow signups' for the anonymous user will allow anonymous
         users to sign up by entering an email address.

   admin signups: allows the selected role to view who has signed up
                  for nodes
   
   Viewing the signup report under Administer > Content management > Signup, and configuring
   Administer > Site configuration > Signup are restricted to users who have the
   'access administration pages' privilege

6. Start signing up!
