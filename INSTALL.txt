It is assumed that you have Drupal up and running.  Be sure to check
the Drupal web site if you need assistance.  If you run into problems,
you should always read the INSTALL.txt that comes with the Drupal
package and read the online documentation.

0. Always backup your database before you enable a new contributed module!

1. Place the signup package into your Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Load the database definition file (signup.mysql) using the
   tool of your choice (e.g. phpmyadmin). For mysql and command line
   access use:
     mysql -u user -p drupal < signup.mysql

   Replace 'user' with the MySQL username, and 'drupal' with the
   database being used.

3. Enable the signup module by navigating to: administer > modules

   Note: if you want support for automatic closing of events and
   reminder emails you must also install and enable the event package!

   Click the 'Save configuration' button at the bottom to commit your
   changes.

4. For the final configuration of the module, navigate to
   administer > settings > signup

   Here you can configure the options for the module.

5. Enable the node types that you wish to allow signups for:

   administer > content > configure (a tab on the content screen) > 
   content types (a subtab on the configure screen) > configure (a link
   on the content types screen - whew!).  You can navigate directly to
   the list of content types by going to: "admin/node/configure/types"
   on your own site.

   You may wish to create a new content type specifically for event
   signups by enabling the "flexinode" module.

6. Grant the proper access to user accounts under: administer > access control
   
   allow signups: allows the selected role to sign up for nodes

   NOTE: Enabling 'allow signups' for the anonymous user will only place a 
         login/register link in any signup node that an anonymous user may
         visit.  Signup module does not currently support signups for 
         anonymous users.

   admin signups: allows the selected role to view who has signed up
                  for nodes
   
   viewing the signup report under administer > signup, and configuring
   administer > settings > signup are restricted to user who have the
   'access administration pages' privilege

7. Start signing up!
