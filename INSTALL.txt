It is assumed that you have Drupal up and running.  Be sure to check
the http://drupal.org web site if you need assistance.  If you run
into problems, you should always read the INSTALL.txt that comes with
the Drupal package and read the online documentation.


0. Always backup your database before you enable a new contributed module!


1. Place the signup package into your Drupal modules/ directory.


2. (Optional) Customize the form presented to users when signing up
   for content on your site.  Unfortuantely, this is not yet a way to
   do this from within your site, you must modify a theme function to
   change this form.  See the comment above "theme_signup_user_form()"
   in the signup.theme file.  You can either modify that version of
   the function, or define your own version in your site's theme.


3. Enable the signup module by navigating to:
   administer > modules

   Note: if you want support for automatic closing of events and
   reminder emails you must also install and enable the event package!

   Click the 'Save configuration' button at the bottom to commit your
   changes.


4. For the final configuration of the module, navigate to:
   administer > settings > signup

   Here you can configure the options for the module.


5. Enable the node types that you wish to allow signups for under:
   administer > settings > content types > configure

   You may wish to create a new content type specifically for event
   signups using either the Flexinode module or the Content
   Construction Kit (CCK).


6. Grant the proper access to user accounts under:
   administer > access control
   
   allow signups: allows the selected role to sign up for nodes

   NOTE: Enabling 'allow signups' for the anonymous user will allow anonymous
         users to sign up by entering an email address.

   admin signups: allows the selected role to view who has signed up
                  for nodes
   
   Viewing the signup report (administer > signup), and configuring
   the module (administer > settings > signup) are restricted to users
   who have the 'access administration pages' privilege.


7. Start signing up!
