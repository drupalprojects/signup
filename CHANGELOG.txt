= #199383 by deviantintegral and dww: Fixed bug that could cause signup
  to invoke node_load() with invalid parameters on the node add form.
= #79331: Fixed inconsistent UI: don't capitalize individual words
  (for example, the UI now uses 'Current signups' and 'Cancel signups').
= #107136: Added $uid parameter to _signup_cancel hook (so it can be
  useful for something) and converted to use module_invoke_all().
= #249155 by joshk: Added the $user object as another argument when

  from theme_signup_user_form().

  that are deleted from the site.
= #145749 by schittli: Added German (de) translation.


-------
5.x-1.0
-------
The first official, stable release of the signup.module that is
compatible with the 5.x core API. This release includes all of the bug
fixes mentioned in the 4.7.x-1.1 release, so please see those release
notes for more details. In particular, 5.x-1.0 includes the same
database update from 4.7.x-1.1 that renames the permissions defined by
the signup.module. Sites upgrading to 5.x-1.0 directly from 4.7.x-1.0
should therefore be sure to run update.php.

In addition to the changes required to function properly with the 5.x
version of Drupal core, the 5.x-1.0 release includes the following changes:
= #49007: The fix for all the UI bugs and weird behavior about
  enabling and disabling signups per-node-type and per-node is
  enhanced in the 5.x-1.0 release by including singup.js to implement
  some additional UI enhancements when JavaScript is enabled. This
  depends on the jQuery support that is only included in 5.x core. On
  JS-enabled browsers, when users with signup administrator permission
  are toggling if signups are enabled or not, the other signup
  settings will be automatically hidden when signups are disabled.
= #118648 by Darren Oh: Send reminders after signups are closed.
= #128287: add hook_uninstall()
= Use 'access administration pages' not 'administer site configuration'
  permission to decide what the signup settings menu item should be called.


---------
4.7.x-1.1
---------
After many months of unfortunate neglect, the singup.module has
recently gotten a round of major attention and improvements.  Mostly,
the changes below are bug fixes, but in a few small cases, some new
functionality was added, as well. This release includes a database
update, which renames the permissions this module uses, so be sure to
run update.php on your site, and then visit your 'access control' page
(at /admin/access) to ensure the signup-related permissions are valid
for the roles defined on your site.

Major changes since 4.7.x-1.0:
= #91284: signup.module doesn't respect privacy: db_rewrite_sql() missing
= #91284: signup_conflicts.module doesn't respect privacy: db_rewrite_sql()
  missing
= Major permissions, UI and usability fixes (includes a DB update):
  - #69367: Turn the "Users can view signups" setting into a permission.
  - #69283: Rename all other permissions to be more clear, consistent, etc.
= #49007: Fix all the UI bugs and weird behavior about enabling and
  disabling signups per-node-type and per-node.
= #102949: For consistency, allow the %info token in reminder emails, too.

Other changes since 4.7.x-1.0:
= #126942: Add "Reset to defaults" on settings page.
= #104804 by hunmonk and dww: Fieldsets are now supported in the
  customized signup form. The code should now handle nested values
  regardless of depth.
= #67067: Required fields and default values on signup form. Inspired by
  a patch from pjdevries. Also cleans up the formatting of the $form
  array in this function, vastly improves the doxygen comment, and
  includes a step in the INSTALL.txt file about customizing this form.
= #125705: Make comment in signup.theme about not touching the
  definition of $form['signup_form_data']['#tree'] even more clear.
= #123648: Fixing improper use of links in watchdog() messages
= #78559: Fixing numerous bugs in signup translation:
  - Incorrect use of format_plural()
  - Badly formed t() strings with HTML and other goo inside wildly
    stale (and sometimes missing) .pot files
= #69372: Ported signup to use theme('username') for user links
= In the (evil, hard-coded) HTML for displaying signup information on
  user profile pages, we were leaving an H4 open by accident.
= l() calls check_plain() for you, so we were double-escaping output.
= #107154: Fix signup_sign_up_user() to prevent the same user from
  signing up more than once for the same node.
= #128021 by adrinux: Convert html br to xhtml and use strong instead of b


---------
4.7.x-1.0
---------
Initial official release from the stable 4.7.x-1.* series. There have
been no changes in the signup module since August 2006, so this should
be the same code as any of the signup-4.7.0.tar.gz files from
2006-08-19 and later. Additional releases of this series will only fix
bugs in the existing functionality.
