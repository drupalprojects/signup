msgid "Signup allows users to sign up (in other words, register) for content of any type. The most common use is for events, where users indicate they are planning to attend. This module includes options for sending a notification email to a selected email address upon a new user signup (good for notifying event coordinators, etc.) and a confirmation email to users who sign up. Each of these options are controlled per node. When used on event nodes (with <a href=\"@event_url\">event.module</a> installed) or nodes that have a date field (with <a href=\"@date_url\">date.module</a>) and regular cron runs, it can also send out reminder emails to all signups a configurable number of days before the start of the event (also controlled per node) and to automatically close signups 1 hour before their start (general setting). Settings exist for resticting signups to selected roles and content types."

Administrative access allows a user to view all the users who have signed up for the node, along with whatever information they included when they signed up.  Signup administrators can also cancel other user's signups for the node, and can close signups on the node entirely (meaning no one else is allowed to sign up)."
